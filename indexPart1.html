        <h4>  We would like to invite you to take part in the following study about
        Sensorimotor Synchronization and Time Perception. Before the experiment, we need your consent to proceed.  </h4>

          <p class="blocktext">
            <b> This study takes up to around 2 hours, including 2 separate parts</b>. Each part takes up to 1 hour.
            You will be compensated <b>â‚¬ 18 + up to 4 euros</b> after completion of the whole study. Please understand that we
            <em> <b>reserve the right to not compensate entries</em> </b>that fail
            to follow instructions.<br>

           <br>
            <b>Introduction:</b> My name is Yuelin LIU.
            I am a doctoral student in the School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences at the
           Peking University, Beijing, and a joint-training student in the institute of Medical Psychology, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.
            I invite you to take part in a research study about sensorimotor synchronization  and time perception..
            This study is approved by the ethical committee of the School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, Peking University, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. <br><br>
            <b> Purpose:</b> The purpose of the study is to examine how people synchronize body
            movement to different sensory stimuli, and how people perceive time. Sensorimotor Synchronization refers to the coordination of rhythmic movement
              with an external rhythm, e.g., grooving with music. <br><br>
            <b> Rights:</b> Participation in research is completely voluntary.
            You have the right to decline to participate or to withdraw at any point in this study
            without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.<br><br>

            <b> Risks/Discomforts:</b> It is possible but unlikely that doing any of the tasks could cause you
            the movements require a minimal amount of effort. These procedures have been used extensively in
            previous research, and we have taken precautions to prevent any discomforts or malfunctions of the
            devices. There is a slight chance you may feel frustrated or uncomfortable if some of the tasks are
            difficult for you to do, but you are free to discontinue your participation in the study if you choose. Please
            let us know if you feel fatigued or uncomfortable at any time during the experiment.<br><br>

            <b>Confidentiality:</b> Your information will be handled as confidentially as possible. Your results will be coded, and you will not be identified in any presentation or publication,
            unless you have specified your permission for this in the attached Media Records Release consent form.
            Your data will be encrypted and securely stored indefinitely on password-protected computers.<br><br>

            <b>Benefits:</b> It is important that you understand there is no direct benefit to you anticipated from your participation in
            this study. Healthy people, such as yourself, provide us with the standard level of performance on these
            tasks. We expect this research to lead to a better understanding of their problems and hope that this knowledge
            will eventually improve treatment for patients with neurological problems. <br><br>
